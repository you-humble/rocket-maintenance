  summary: Pay for an order
  description: >
    Processes payment for a previously created order.  
    The service looks up the order by order_uuid. If the order exists and is
    in PENDING_PAYMENT status, it calls PaymentService.PayOrder with
    user_uuid, order_uuid, and payment_method. After a successful payment,
    the order status is set to PAID and transaction_uuid and payment_method
    are stored.
  operationId: PayOrder
